Put the answers to the debugging questions from Problem One in this file.

Q1:
numDisks: 5
start: 'A'
finish: 'C'
temp: 'B'

Q2:
The function was defined in the file TowersOfHanoiGUI.cpp
The function is called "makeTheMagicHappen"

Q3:
Total moves required to solve this instance of TowersOfHanoi: 31

Q4:
The value of totalMoves after executing the first recursive call: 15

Q5:
Any two-character string will produce the error. For example: "ab", which will produce a permutation of "aba".

Q6:
The error in the program is the "=" sign in chosen += ch

Q7:
We'll use the example with string "ab" to illustrate the general bug in the code.

1. In the first call, we jump into the case i=0 and the recursive function assigns "a" as char 
   and "b" as remaining and calls the next recursive call correctly, permutationsRec(b,a). 
   Chosen here is an empty string, so the function is calling an empty string + char.

2. In the second call, the recursive function assigns "b" as char and an empty string as remaining,
   it calls the next recursive function, permutationsRec("", ab). Notice that this is the addition of 
   chosen=a and char=b.

3. This third call triggers the base case and returns chosen, which at this point is "ab". However,
   when it goes to the previous stack, chosen is really "a", because each function call holds local copies of 
   the variables

4. Then, the recursive function goes into the next case, where i=1. We will begin to explore what happens if we
   choose b first, instead of choosing a first.

5. In this case, the string is "ab", but chosen is "a"! Because we are looking at "b" now, the function will assign
   "b" as char, and "a" as remaining. It will then call the function permutationsRec(a, ab). This last argument
   is chosen =+ char.

6. In the next call, the recursive function will take "a" as char and an empty string as remaining. It will then call
   permutationsRec("", aba), which will return "aba". This is the mistake!
